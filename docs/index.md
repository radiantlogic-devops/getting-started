# Welcome to Radiant Logic DevOps

This site provides resources for DevOps professionals to deploy the RadiantOne platform. Docker images and Kubernetes for orchestration allows for easily deploying the RadiantOne platform in the cloud.

## Docker Images
Radiant Logic provides preconfigured images of RadiantOne in Docker containers. Once deployed, the product is entirely operable. The containers are preconfigured to interoperate with other containers in the stack. 

You can find our available Docker images on our Docker Hub site.

## Kubernetes
You can use Kubernetes to orchestrate the configuration and deployment of RadiantOne. Radiant Logic provides DevOps images for deployments on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## License
A valid license is required to use RadiantOne. For Docker and Kubernetes deployments, have your Radiant Logic license key ready. If you need a license key, send your request to [support@radiantlogic.com](mailto:support@radiantlogic.com).
